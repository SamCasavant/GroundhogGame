# GroundhogGame

## Introduction

A Rust/Bevy ECS game that uses autonomous agents to build out a small, deterministic open world. 

The python/ directory contains an earlier text-based attempt which runs too slowly to be useful and has some architectural issues. It is included for reference purposes in further development, as much of the logic has not been implemented in the new rust version. 

This project is not currently in an operational state, as it was written shortly after Bevy was publicized and is not up-to-date with the latest versions of libraries.
